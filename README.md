# Aburto Lab Code Repository
We are the Aburto Lab at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO) at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD). The Aburto Lab is also the origin of the Gulf of California Marine Program and other initiatives.


## Our Mission
The Aburto Lab is dedicated to ocean conservation and biodiversity.
Our lab believes that, by revising the narrative of science and reframing the traditional scientific framework, we can have a much greater impact. We value teaching and inspiring the next generation of scientists under this new framework by training the skill of storytelling to influence real conservation methods.
